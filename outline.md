# Public Speaking Workshop

## What are the Goals of this Workshop?

### Think Analytically about Presentations

We're going to try and break down presentations in a way that helps you think more analytically about them.

**Help You Assess Your Audience**

**Assemble a Narrative**

**Reframe Your Delivery Style**

It's our goal to make the concept of public speaking more approachable.

### Prepare You to Practice Effectively

We generally understand that we need to practice presentations (and that's not a bad idea).
We don't always know the best way to practice.
The right techniques will go a long way towards helping us be more confident and comfortable.

### Provide an Interactive Facilitators' Session

## Motivations

### Why Me?

Innovators' Challenge at Lockheed Martin

Had to present a lot

Presenting to a VP with 24 hours notice

Audience, story, delivery

### Why You?

What makes public speaking important?

What makes public speaking scary?

Enabling individuals to find their voice and present comfortably leads to:

*   More confidence
*   Better job satisfaction
*   Increased career mobility

If I can help a single "quiet" person find their voice, this workshop will be worth the effort.

### Why Now?

The need for verbal communication is still very much live.

The techniques we learn today will apply just as well to written communication.

During WFH, Remote Presenting is an environment where you can lean into discomfort and try things that would stress you out otherwise.

## Personas

Lots of people respond to the stress of having to present differently. Let's take a look at a few personas that represent coping strategies with some serious side effects.

To be clear, **personas are caricatures designed to highlight practices we want to establish**. They're not indictments of people who want to become better presenters, nor are they modeled after real people. Their purpose, simply put, is to let you see some of the concepts we'll talk about, grounded with an applied example.

### The Blabbermouth

Finds the idea of presenting stressful, so...he doesn't dwell on it much.

Talks and talks...and talks.

Doesn't seem to know (or care) what his audience thinks or needs to know.

### The Absent-minded Professor

Knows the subject material.

Struggles to share his ideas with his colleagues.

Peers report that he's scattershot, lots of information but few cogent ideas.

### The Worrywart

Finds Public Speaking

Little bit of a control freak

Likes to write down what he's going to say verbatim

Best case? Sounds like a parrot. Worst case? Freezes up when things go off track.

## The Three Elements

### Audience

#### Who are They?

It's instinctual to immediately think about what you're going to say.

It's wise to think about who's going to hear it first

Taking a moment to understand your audience will pay off significantly in the long run.

#### What Do They Care About?

What is the reason people are gathering to listen to you?

*   Review of a proposal
*   Hearing lessons learned
*   Learning about something new

Knowing why people are there helps you better understand how to speak to them.

#### How Can You Help?

In a sentence, how can you help your audience?

*   I can give you confidence that this system is designed properly.
*   I learned a lot of things the hard way, so you don't have to!
*   I've got a cool tool or process that you'll benefit from.

This can _feel_ obvious, but taking a moment to think about this is super clarifying.

### Story

#### What's Your Narrative?

You've thought about your audience and you know what kind of help you can provide.

What's the story you can tell?

*   If we adopt this new process, we'll generate 20% more leads
*   If we had completed some pre-planning tasks, we would have been faster to market by a month.
*   If you start using this new workflow, you will significantly reduce the chance of errors.

The narrative is where we fit the content in your head to the audience in front of you.

#### The Spectrum of Understanding

Everyone has a different depth of understanding.

Pull from old slides.

#### What Does Your Audience Need To Know?

When it comes to gauging your audience's understanding, it's possible to get it very, very wrong.

Spend time boiling down your narrative to the basics, then add detail to fit your audience's understanding.

### Delivery

#### A Word On Rehearsal

If rehearsal isn't a requirement for this guy, why do we think we need to rehearse?

It isn't about practicing the material, it's about practicing the speaking.

#### Conversational Style

Think of the last time you've told someone close to you a story. Did you rehearse the story ahead of time? Did you have cue cards? Probably not. And yet, it felt natural and easy.

Storytelling comes naturally to us because it's how our brains are wired. Oral tradition is a strong signifier of this as well.

If you can cultivate this same sense of confort and feeling when presenting yourself, you can feel more at ease and in command of your material.

#### Perfect Practice

The intern with speaking notes. I asked him to go back 3 slides and his entire presentation fell apart.

He was practicing, he was working really hard. What happened?

Practice does not make perfect. Perfect practice is what you need to practice.

Bring in material from old slide deck.
